homebrew-tap
============

YPlan formulae for Homebrew.

To access the forumlae within, add to `brew` with:

    brew tap yplan/homebrew-tap

Then you can `brew install` them. If the formula is also in the main Homebrew repo, you need to use the fully qualified name to get our version, for example:

    brew install yplan/homebrew-tap/arcanist
